[UPDATE] Firefox now shows scam warning on copy pasting commands in the developer console.
To avoid that, simply enter the command `allow pasting` in the console.
After running that command, copy pasting will start to work.

[UPDATE] `variants/PosFeedback.js` is added, which replaces the word `NIL` with positive feedback for the instructor and the course randomly selected from a list of comments.
Follow the same steps to use the script.
